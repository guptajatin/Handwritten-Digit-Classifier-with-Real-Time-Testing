Handwritten Digit Classification with Live Testing

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for recognizing handwritten digits in real-time. Users can draw digits using an interactive interface, and the trained model classifies them instantly with high accuracy. It showcases the practical application of deep learning for visual pattern recognition tasks like digit classification.

## Features
- Real-time testing using live user input through an interactive interface.
- **CNN model** trained on the popular MNIST dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
- Achieves **99.05% test accuracy** on the MNIST dataset.
- Integrated with **OpenCV** for live drawing and input capture.

## Demo
- Draw a digit on the screen using a mouse.
- The model will predict the digit in real-time and display the result.
